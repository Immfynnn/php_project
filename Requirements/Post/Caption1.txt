PRAYER TO ST. ROSE OF LIMA | Saint Rose, pray for us that we may one day glorify the Blessed Trinity in heaven. Obtain for us your lively faith that we may consider all people, things, and events in the light of God. Pray, that we may be generous in making sacrifices of worldly things as you so wisely did. Please, also, pray for me and my intentions (State your intentions here).
God our Father, St. Rose gave everything to devote herself to You through her life of penance. With the help of her prayers, we seek to imitate her selfless way of life so that we may enjoy the splendor of Heaven. Please grant this through our Lord Jesus Christ who lives and reigns forever and ever. Amen. 
Saint Rose of Lima, pray for us!
